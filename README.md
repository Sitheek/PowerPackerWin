This repository  contains three folders, 

One folder PowerPacker32, is a VC++ build of the powerpack project, pulled from [https://github.com/ipr/PowerPacker-decrunch](https://github.com/ipr/PowerPacker-decrunch "PowerPacker-decrunch") with modifactions made to make it a dll capable of exports.

The second folder is PowerPackerExample, this contains a c# example of the DLL in operation

The third folder called 'Release' contains a .net4 build of a viewer/converter that is built version of the above example.
